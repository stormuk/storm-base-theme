# Storm Base Theme 

> :warning: This theme is now deprecated. In WordPress 5.8 Full Site Editing is due to arrive, and this will fundamentally change the way themes are built. As part of this, we're moving to a more modern theme structure based about [Roots' Sage 10](https://github.com/roots/sage).

This was the base theme for all new Storm WordPress builds.

## Requirements

You'll need to have the following items installed before continuing.

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer provided on the NodeJS website.
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/): Run `npm install -g gulp-cli`

Make sure you either get this code by downloading a tagged release, or if you git clone, you remove the .git folder when you copy the base theme into another git controlled project or you'll get very confused. Then you can just run `npm install` in your theme folder, followed by `gulp` to run the watch task, or `gulp deploy` for the minified deploy assets.
